				<h2>Background Image Exercises</h2>

				<h3>Focus on:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>using <code>background-image</code> property</li>
					<li>using
						<code>background-repeat, background-attachment, background-size, background-position</code>
						properties
					</li>
					<li>refining design with sampled colors, borders, padding</li>
					<li>use validators to check and correct work:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML validator</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">CSS validator</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>This exercise contains four pages that you need to style:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Big Background</li>
					<li>Tiled Background</li>
					<li>Banner Background</li>
					<li>Hero Image</li>
				</ol>

				<p>There are screenshots that you need to emulate as closely as possible. You will need to add the
					styles to put a background image in the page as needed, and to finish up the design so it
					matches the screenshot. Each page will need you to use some box properties (mostly padding and
					border, depending on the page) to achieve the look.</p>

				<p>The background position example is to help you see how it is that <code>background-position</code>
					works. You only need to use keywords to center the background images at the top of the viewport in
					pages 1 and 2. You don't need to do any work in the background position example. It is to help you
					learn.</p>

				<h3>Workflow</h3>
				<h4>1: Big Background</h4>
				<p>Use the big viburnum image in the background of the body. This is how you get an image to fill the
					viewport. It has fairly large pixel dimensions so it should be larger than the largest viewport.
					However, take note: it is under .5 meg in file size. Don't let your background images have large
					file sizes. It's inconsiderate.</p>

				<p>This uses background position to get the image displaying at the top and center of the display box
					(the body). View the background position example in this exercise to help you understand how this
					works.</p>

				<p>The wrapper has a border, some padding, and a background color using <code>rgba()</code> syntax so
					that it is translucent. Otherwise it would be next to impossible to read the text on top of the
					image.</p>

				<p>Experiment with background-attachment so you can see what it actually does in the browser; it is a
					bit difficult to describe it, but you'll be able to see it in action.</p>

				<h4>2: Tiled Background</h4>
				<p>This uses a tiled image in the background of the body (the browser will tile automatically). The
					background and border colors are sampled from the image. If you use background position to bring the
					first instance of the image in at center top, then it "moves" with the wrapper when you change the
					viewport width. Try it to see what I mean!</p>

				<h4>3: Header Background</h4>
				<p>This exercise puts the background image in the header. You'll need to set the height of the header so
					the entire image shows. Border and background colors are sampled from the image itself in Photoshop.
				</p>

				<p>This design uses <code>text-align</code> to center the site id. You'll need to edit the h1 style to
					align the text and to get a translucent background color in the h1! And some padding! and maybe even
					zero out margins!</p>

				<h4>4: Hero Image</h4>
				<p>This page has a hero image that goes in the background of the main. The image is wide and narrow so that it
					extends beyond the live space on very wide viewports. This is important to understand when working
					with hero images.</p>
				</p>

				<p>This design uses multiple wrappers (already in the markup and styled) so that the live space is
					limited, but backgrounds are not. This is different from the Banner Background, which puts the
					background image inside a fixed-width banner.</p>

				<p>You'll notice that the hero image is wide and narrow so that it will extend beyond the live space in
					a very wide viewport. It's important that you understand such hero images must be formatted in this
					way.</p>

				<h3>Validation</h3>
				<p>You want to be sure you've written valid markup and valid styles. Use the online validator tools to
					check your work. If there are errors, <strong>read what the validator says about them</strong> and
					check the lines in your markup where the errors occur.
